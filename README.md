# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Try to find a correlation on what makes a restaurant popular. Does the distance, location, features (eg. alcohol, dining outside) have an effect?

## Process
### (your step 1)
In the notebooks folder are 4 files with the ipynb extension.
I have picked a location in latitude and longitude in Toronto and found 100 bike stations
### (your step 2)

## Results
I have found out that the number of free bikes doesn't rely too much on other independent variables and it seems like price fits the model the best. 

## Challenges 
I have initially picked a different coordinate in Germany. There was no data from the yelp API and I thought I was at fault. I ended up changing to a city in Toronto and it was solved.

## Future Goals
I would compare more features in the API and look at different types of plotting libraries to compare them.
